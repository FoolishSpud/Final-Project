        <h1>But what are some elements of the game that actually make the game good?<h1>

        <ol>
        <li>Fluid, rebindable controls</li>
        <li>Intricately designed lore</li>
        <li>Intriguing characters</li>
        <li>Beautiful artwork and visually appealing design</li>
        <li>Amazing combat system</li>
        <li>Epic boss fights</li>
        <li>Difficult but rewarding platforming challenges</li>
        <li>A customizable playstyle through the game's charms</li>
