        <p>I first heard of Hollow Knight around June of 2022, while I was watching a YouTube video. From the moment I saw the game, I was hooked. After several months of asking, I finally got the game around December of 2022.</p>
        <p>Then, for the next five months, I was completely hooked. I ran through a ton of what the game had to offer, got the main ending, and 112%'d the game (the max % you can get). Then I somewhat grew tired of it and set it aside.</p>
        <p>Then, I was at a Christmas party with some of my friends in December of 2023. One of them was browsing through my games and saw Hollow Knight, and he expressed interest in trying it out, which I happily agreed to. After a few weeks, he finished with it and gave me my cartridge back, but that event had re-ignited the spark I had for Hollow Knight.</p>
        <p>After I got the game back, I re-ran through the game several times, cleaned up the rest of the more difficult things I never completed, and set out on a mission to convince the rest of my friends to try it, even further solidifying the sheer passion I had and still do have for the game.</p>
        <p>One of the things I did was beat the hardest boss in the game without getting hit! Below is a video of me doing that.</p>
